This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

You can now download the app via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirasiris.anonymoussecretsapp)

## Intro

> Introducing Anonymous Secrets: a mobile app where users can share secrets freely and securely. With options to password-protect your messages and set a 24-hour expiration for added privacy, Anonymous Secrets ensures your confidential thoughts are shared only as long as you want. Join a community of trust, where secrets are kept safe and sound!

Try **Anonymous Secrets**, a safe place to confess and share your deepest secrets anonymously with others

## A bit of Background

The word anonymous is usually linked to words like privacy, secrecy, confidentiality and such. Thus, Anonymous Secrets was born.

The app's name embodies its promise: a trusted community where your deepest thoughts are kept secure, offering the freedom to express yourself fully without compromise.
